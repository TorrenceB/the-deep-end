## Introduction

I take great pride in declaring this as my first official blog post. My motivation for writing this blog is two-fold; the first being a means to grow and develop my personal knowledge in the field of Front-End Web Development. The second and most important reason, is to help others who are new to this world by bringing value through simple and elegant explanations of fundamentals that I've personally struggled with. You can expect more content from me other than just various programming and design topics! I plan on covering other passions, namely Photography and Self-Development so be sure to check back if these are areas of interest to you as well!
